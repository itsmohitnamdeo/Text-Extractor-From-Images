A web app for performing OCR on images. Upload one or more images, select the language of the document(s), and then view and edit the OCR-ed text in your browser (or save it as a .txt file!)

This app can also be used offline. Click the [Offline Build](https://github.com/ian-nai/In-Browser-OCR/tree/master/Offline_Build) link here or above to download the files you need to run the app without connecting to the internet. Save the files in the same folder, open the offline_index.html file, and you're good to go.
